# My Biography:

I'm 53 years old and have been working since I was 14. I entered the IT field at 17 as a Computer Science instructor, teaching Wordstar, Lotus 123, MS Basic, and MS Cobol. At 19, I transitioned to software development, working with Clipper, MS Cobol, Blis Cobol, LISP, SQL Windows, Informix/4GL, SQL Server, among other platforms.

As a programming enthusiast, I have been studying C++, Assembly, JAVA, and LINUX for many years, continuously expanding my technical knowledge and skills.

I'm naturally into lifelong learning because I love always learning new things.

For the past 20 years, my time has been divided between development and technical project management, focusing on problem-solving and delivery-oriented solutions. I have led projects primarily on the SAS and SQL ANSI platforms. Although my involvement in development has decreased, my passion for coding has never waned.

In 2024, I am embarking on a personal mission to return to coding, my lifelong passion. I am committed to refreshing and updating my skills, reconnecting with the latest trends and innovations in programming.
