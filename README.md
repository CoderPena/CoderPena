# My Biography:

I'm 53 years old and have been working since I was 14. I entered the IT field at 17 as a Computer Science instructor, teaching Wordstar, Lotus 123, MS Basic, and MS Cobol. At 19, I transitioned to software development, working with Clipper, MS Cobol, Blis Cobol, LISP, SQL Windows, Informix/4GL, SQL Server, among other platforms.

As a programming enthusiast, I have been studying C++, Assembly, JAVA, and LINUX for many years, continuously expanding my technical knowledge and skills.

For the past 20 years, my time has been divided between development and technical project management, focusing on problem-solving and delivery-oriented solutions. I have led projects primarily on the SAS and SQL ANSI platforms. Although my involvement in development has decreased, my passion for coding has never waned.

In 2024, I am embarking on a personal mission to return to coding, my lifelong passion. I am committed to refreshing and updating my skills, reconnecting with the latest trends and innovations in programming.
